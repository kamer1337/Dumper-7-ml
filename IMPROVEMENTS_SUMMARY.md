## Existing Optimizations Documented

The following existing optimizations were documented:

1. **Hit Counter Pattern** (PackageManager)
   - Replaces std::unordered_set for visited tracking
   - ~30% performance improvement
   - O(1) visited check vs O(log n)

2. **Topological Sorting** (PackageManager)
   - Ensures correct dependency order
   - Single-pass visitation
   - Cycle detection capability

3. **Member Sorting** (PredefinedMembers.h)
   - Efficient comparison functions
   - Static weak ordering
   - Minimal comparison operations

4. **String Handling** (Throughout)
   - std::string_view for read-only params
   - std::format for composition
   - Capacity reservation

5. **Container Management** (Throughout)
   - Reserve capacity when known
   - Move semantics
   - Emplace vs push_back

## Next Steps (Optional Future Work)

The following are **optional** improvements that could be made in the future:

- Add unit tests for sorting functions
- Create video tutorials for building and using SDK
- Add more code examples to documentation
- Create FAQ document
- Add badges to README (build status, version, etc.)
- Generate API documentation with Doxygen
- Add performance benchmarking suite

## Conclusion

This PR significantly improves the Dumper-7 project by:

1. **Adding comprehensive documentation** for users, contributors, and developers
2. **Explaining existing optimizations** so they're understood and preserved
3. **Providing clear guidelines** for contributing and using the project
4. **Maintaining code quality** while improving clarity

All changes follow the principle of **minimal modifications** - no logic was changed, only documentation was added to make the project more accessible and understandable.
